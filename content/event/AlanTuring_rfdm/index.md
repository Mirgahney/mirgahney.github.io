summary: This talk explores the core paradigms of statistical machine learning, highlighting their principles, applications, and impact in creating intelligent systems.
abstract: 'Statistical machine learning leverages mathematical and probabilistic principles to extract patterns and make predictions from data. This talk explores key paradigms—supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning—along with advanced approaches like probabilistic models, ensemble methods, and deep learning. We will highlight their principles, applications, and real-world impact across different domains. Attendees will gain a clear understanding of these paradigms’ roles in building intelligent systems and driving innovation.'
